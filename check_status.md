# Application Status Check

## Backend Status
The backend server is running at http://localhost:8000

✅ **Backend is UP and running!**
- FastAPI server started successfully
- Running on port 8000
- API documentation available at: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Note: Redis is not running, so caching is disabled (this is fine for demo)

## Frontend Status
The frontend development server should be running at http://localhost:3000

To start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Testing the Application

1. **Open the Frontend**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

2. **Check API Docs**: Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to see the API documentation

3. **Test File Upload**:
   - Use the sample files in the `/samples` directory
   - Try `equipment_inventory.csv` or `driver_database.csv`

4. **Test the Flow**:
   - Upload a CSV file
   - See AI-powered column mapping suggestions
   - Review validation issues
   - Preview cleaned data
   - Check cost metrics

## Troubleshooting

If the frontend isn't running:
1. Open a new terminal
2. Navigate to the frontend directory
3. Run `npm install` if needed
4. Run `npm run dev`

If you see import errors:
- The imports have been fixed
- The frontend should compile successfully now
